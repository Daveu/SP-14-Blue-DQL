# SP-14-Blue-DQL
This repository will contain our final project implementation of a Deep Q-Learner for Cuphead. The AI agent will attempt to beat the blue slime boss through many iterations of training and acting on the environment via emulated keystrokes.
I am currently working on merging the Object Recognition portion of our agent that will create the environment state used by the Q-Learner model to observe and act.
Upon completion of this merging, training will begin as the model plays the game and records history of states and actions.
